Powerful AI is moving from the cloud to the client — and this is your chance to build with it!  
Join the **Google Chrome Built-in AI Challenge 2025** to create new web applications or Chrome Extensions using a suite of built-in AI APIs and powerful models, including **Gemini Nano**.

### Build with Built-in AI APIs

Here’s how you can use Chrome’s built-in APIs to bring your ideas to life:

- 💭 **Prompt API:** Generate dynamic user prompts and structured outputs, now with multimodal support for **image** and **audio** input.
- 🔤 **Proofreader API:** Correct grammar mistakes with ease.
- 📄 **Summarizer API:** Distill complex information into clear insights.
- 🌐 **Translator API:** Add multilingual capabilities and translate text into your preferred language.
- ✏️ **Writer API:** Create original and engaging text.
- 🖊️ **Rewriter API:** Improve content with alternative options.

These APIs run **client-side**, meaning your AI features are delivered locally — with privacy, offline access, and cost-efficiency benefits.

### Why Local AI Matters

- ⚙️ **Creative freedom:** Build freely without server costs or quotas, enabling proactive AI patterns.
- 🔒 **Inherent privacy:** Deliver hyper-personalized experiences that never leave the user’s device.
- ✅ **Network-resilient UX:** Ensure consistent performance, even offline or on unstable networks.

### Hybrid AI Options

Extend your web app or extension to reach mobile users with a hybrid AI approach using either:

- [**Firebase AI Logic**](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ai-logic/hybrid-on-device-inference?api=dev)
- **Gemini Developer API**

### Get Started

Join the [**Chrome Built-in AI Early Preview Program**](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/join-epp) to gain access to documentation, stay up-to-date with new APIs, and connect with the Chrome community.  
Whether you’re a seasoned developer or a first-time hacker, this challenge is your opportunity to shape the future of client-side AI.

> **Note:** All hackathon projects must be new and original for 2025.  
> Projects from the 2024 hackathon cannot be reused or re-submitted.
