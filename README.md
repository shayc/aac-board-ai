_Google Chrome Built-in AI Challenge 2025_

## Overview

AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) tools help people who cannot rely on speech communicate through symbols, text, or synthesized voice. These tools often use communication boards ‚Äî visual grids of pictures or words that users tap to form messages.

**AAC Board AI** brings these boards to life with [Chrome's Built-in AI](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/built-in), adding real-time corrections and tone control so messages feel natural and expressive ‚Äî all powered locally by Gemini Nano for fast, private, reliable offline communication.

## Impact & Motivation

**The Problem:**  
Traditional AAC communication boards help people with speech disabilities express themselves through symbols, but they lack natural language processing. Users tap pictograms to form messages word-by-word, often resulting in grammatically incorrect or contextually inappropriate sentences like "me want drink water" instead of "I want to drink water."

**The Solution:**  
AAC Board AI uses Chrome's Built-in AI to transform pictogram-based messages into natural, grammatically correct sentences with adjustable tone ‚Äî all processed locally on the user's device for privacy and offline reliability.

**Who Benefits:**
- üßë People with cerebral palsy, autism, aphasia, or other speech disabilities
- üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Speech-language therapists and AAC specialists
- üë™ Caregivers and family members

**Why Built-in AI Matters:**
- ‚úÖ **Privacy:** All processing happens on-device
- ‚úÖ **Offline:** Works without internet after initial setup
- ‚úÖ **Free:** No API costs or usage limits
- ‚úÖ **Fast:** Real-time corrections with Gemini Nano

**Key Features:**
- **Grammar Correction** ‚Äì Instantly fixes grammar using the [Proofreader API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/proofreader-api)
- **Tone Adjustment** ‚Äì Rewrites phrases for casual, formal, or neutral delivery through the [Rewriter API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/rewriter-api)
- **Multi-Language Support** ‚Äì Translates messages seamlessly between languages with the [Translator API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/translator-api)
